        The Cornerstone community is a busy one, so we still have a few outstanding pull requests submitted to the Cornerstone and CornerstoneTools GitHub repositories.
        Also, we look forward to continuing to work with the community to mantain our code in those repositories if probems arise.

        There's still a lot of work to be done on the LibreHealth radiology module.
        We can't wait to see its first release!
