      <h1>The Project</h1>
      <p>
        Below, we have embedded the slides from our comps project presentation. The slides summarize our motivation for working
        on the project, our contributions to OpenMRS, LibreHealth and Cornerstone, and the challenges that we encountered along
        the way, along with some background information on medical open source software.
